This is the repository for codes written in Software Engineering Class taught by Professor Hideyuki Kawashima @ Keio University in 2022 Fall Semester

## 1_oct7
### hello.c
A program which prints out "Hello, SFC" after executing.

### list.c
A program which creates a linked list which contains 100 elements (integers from 1 to 100) and prints out all elements horizontally with spaces between each of them after executing.

## 2_oct14
### bs.c
A program which creates an array containing all integers from 1 to MAX_VALUE designated with ascending order, and conduct binary search for the key that inputed by user, with the step of search print out as the result.

### hash.c
A program which creates an array containing all integers from 1 to MAX_VALUE designated with ascending order, and conduct hash search for the key that inputed by user, with the step of search print out as the result.

## 3_oct21
### sort.c
A program which creates an array containing MAX_VALUE of random integer from 1 to MAX_VALUE designated, and conduct following search alrogithms:

* Insertion sort
* Quick sort
* Count sort
* I can't believe it can sort

And user can choose:

* which algorithm for sorting (comment out other sorting algorithms)
* print out the array that before sorting, after sorting, and the time the algorithm costs (Comment out the corresponding code if there is no need to print out)

## 4_oct28
B-plus tree
* Leaf Insert
* Leaf Split
* Internal Split

## 8_dec2
Counters
* Non-lock
* Pthread lock (mutex)
* TAS
* TTAS
* Atomic fetch and add
